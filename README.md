# overview

This is a condensed folder containing the core processes required to reproduce the results for the paper. 'evaluation.py' is the main file which produces the results. 'main.py' is the primary file which handles dataset augmentation, while 'classifier_small.py' is the primary file which handles EfficientNet fine-tuning.

# bioacoustic data augmentation pipeline

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- edit config.yaml
- run main.py

### - provide dataset folder path containing:
1. audio of individual mask-cropped vocalisations (details below)
2. mask-cropped 'negative' examples for adversarial (optional, details below)
3. background noise (files must be longer than output length, default 10s)

each category may have a tags.csv file containing:
- a 'filename' column.
- vocalisations csv needs 'species' column to get labelled output.
- (optional) noise can have a csv with 'highpass' and 'lowpass' columns. these constrain the bandpass filter applied to soundscapes generated using that noise clip.
- negative category doesn't need a tags file but it won't break anything.

example folder structure:

    example_dataset/
        vocalisations/
            1.wav
            tags.csv
        negative/
            3.wav
        noise/
            2.wav
            tags.csv

vocalisations and negative should be cropped from background e.g.
![spec](output_example_1.png)

### output

- primary outputs spectrograms and labels in {output}/artificial_dataset
- labels are format: class, x_center, y_center, width, height
- train + test
- optionally output audio
- optionally output vocalisation masks (as COCO json file)
- randomly repeats some vocalisations (see top left, below)
- labels are stored as integers, so a .csv map is generated

output example:
![spec](output_example.png)

the function can generate richly labelled training data.

todo: 
- gpu-accelerate
- add .flac option
- a way to turn off log scale in config
